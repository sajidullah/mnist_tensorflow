MNIST CLASSIFICATION IN TENSORFLOW
CLASSIFICATIN OF DIGITS(0-9) AND TEN CLASSES OF FASHION-MNIST
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and 
a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for
benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
